hiiii omg hiiiiiii!!!!

So Button Studio is a program created in the Godot Engine 3.5.1 to quickly and easily generate a lot of button prompts in the form of 128x128 png files. It creates most necessary keyboard keys, buttons for most popular gamepads which use letters, and a few extra bits.
It accomplishes this using Godot's StyleBoxFlat system to draw the back of the prompt, and then puts text on top of it for relevant keys/buttons.
It's very incomplete in its current state, alongside having very sloppy code, but it can overall get the job done and save time creating button prompts that may be in line with your game's aesthetic.

The interface is simple. You get a preview of the button and you get your options on the side. You cna change which button you're previewing, and then batch export all the buttons.

This is best used in conjunction with [KoBeWi's Action Icon plugin](https://github.com/KoBeWi/Godot-Action-Icon) for Godot, which is only in the code for testing purposes. The file structure and filenames generated by this program are designed to go right into this plugin, and from my experience it works smoothly.
